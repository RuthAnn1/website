          <p>
            Nature is deeply woven into everyday life in Norway. Time outdoors
            is seen as essential for balance, reflection, and well being.

          <h2>Calm Cities and Simple Design</h2>
          <p>
            Cities are designed to feel open and calm, with clean lines,

          <p>
            Social connections often grow slowly and quietly. While people may
            seem reserved at first, relationships tend to be deep and lasting
            once trust is built.

          <p>
